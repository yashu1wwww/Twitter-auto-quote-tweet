Here, I have added up to three accounts that can auto-login to quote posts. If you need more, simply copy lines 100 to 144 and paste them on line 145, and don't forget to change the username and password.

Make sure to change the username and password on lines 14 and 15, as well as in any other location where the username and password are requested in the qrt.py file. Additionally, change the text in the qrt.py file and update the URL in the url.txt file.

(Note: for auto-login, you must use non-authentication accounts.)

To begin, download the latest version of the Chrome Driver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/, extract the file, and place it in the designated folder. Then, open the command prompt in that folder and enter "qrt.py" or double-click on the qrt.py file

👉Note:-

👉if your selenium version is in latest version then the code never run

👉open cmd and enter pip uninstall selenium

And enter

pip install selenium==4.2.1 or pip install selenium==4.2.0

and hit enter

and

python -c "import selenium; print(selenium.version)"
